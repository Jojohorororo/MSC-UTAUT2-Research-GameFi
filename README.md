# MSC UTAUT2 Research - GameFi

## 🎓 Thesis Title
**"GameFi: Opportunities, Challenges and Prospects"** 
*Master of Science Dissertation | University of Western Macedonia | MSc in “Electronic Business and Digital Marketing” / 2024-2025*

## 📊 Project Overview
This repository contains the research data and analysis for a Master's thesis investigating user adoption and behavioral intentions in GameFi (Gaming Finance) platforms using the UTAUT2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2) framework.

## 🎮 Research Context
GameFi represents the intersection of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), where players can earn cryptocurrency and NFTs through gameplay. This study examines the psychological and behavioral factors influencing user adoption of GameFi platforms.

## 🔬 Research Scope
- **Sample Size**: 516 participants
- **Geographic Focus**: Emerging markets with emphasis on Southeast Asia and Latin America  
- **Population**: Active GameFi platform users
- **Framework**: Extended UTAUT2 with GameFi-specific behavioral constructs
- **Analysis**: Comprehensive reliability analysis and construct validation

## 📊 Data Collection Status
- ✅ Data collection completed
- ✅ Reliability analysis completed  
- 🔄 Advanced statistical analysis in progress
- 📝 Thesis writing in progress
