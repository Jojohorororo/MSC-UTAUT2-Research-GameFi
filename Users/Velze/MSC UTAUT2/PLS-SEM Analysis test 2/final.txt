================================================================================
MODERATION 1: Experience × (Effort Expectancy → Behavioral Intention)
================================================================================
Theory: Learning curve effects - experience should reduce impact of perceived difficulty
ΔR² = 0.0342
Interaction: β = -0.3251 ***

================================================================================
MODERATION 2: Experience × (Social Influence → Behavioral Intention)
================================================================================
Theory: Social influence stronger for novices, weaker for experts
ΔR² = 0.0010
Interaction: β = +0.0488 ns

================================================================================
MODERATION 3: Experience × (Facilitating Conditions → Use Behavior)
================================================================================
Theory: Facilitating conditions more important for experienced users
ΔR² = 0.0023
Interaction: β = -0.0782 ns

================================================================================
MODERATION 4: Experience × (Habit → Behavioral Intention)
================================================================================
Theory: Habit effects stronger for experienced users
ΔR² = 0.0012
Interaction: β = -0.0553 ns

================================================================================
MODERATION 5: Experience × (Habit → Use Behavior)
================================================================================
Theory: Habit-behavior link stronger for experienced users
ΔR² = 0.0057
Interaction: β = -0.1094 ns
