1. Basic Response Distribution Chart

2. Distribution Curve/Histogram
Distribution Analysis:
   • Skewness: -1.082 (0 = symmetric, <0 = left-skewed, >0 = right-skewed)
   • Kurtosis: 1.261 (0 = normal, >0 = peaked, <0 = flat)
   • Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk): p = 0.0000
     ** Data may not be normally distributed (p ≤ 0.05)

3. Box Plot Analysis (FIXED - No More Overlapping!)
Box Plot Insights:
   ** Mean ≈ Median (4.09 ≈ 4.00): Symmetric distribution
   • IQR = 1.00: Moderate variability - reasonable spread in responses
   • 50% of responses fall between 4.00 and 5.00
   • Distribution shape: symmetric
   ** Potential outliers detected: 27 responses outside normal range
