EE4 is the "problem" item:

Still acceptable (correlation > 0.3)
Much lower correlation (0.56 vs 0.82+ for others)
Removing EE4 would increase α to 0.9187 (from "Good" to "Excellent")

"The Effort Expectancy scale demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's α = .886, n = 516). All four items showed adequate corrected item-total correlations ranging from .556 to .832, indicating good discrimination."
