RELIABILITY ANALYSIS RESULTS
======================================================================
Cronbach's Alpha: 0.8947
Note: This is a 2-item scale. Cronbach's Alpha for 2-item scales
is equivalent to the Spearman-Brown stepped-up reliability.
Reliability Level: Good

Number of Items: 2
Number of Cases: 516

Item   Corrected Item-Total Cronbach's Î± if
       Correlation          Item Deleted   
---------------------------------------------
RC1             0.8096    N/A (1 item)
RC2             0.8096    N/A (1 item)

Inter-item Correlation (RC1-RC2): 0.8096
Note: For 2-item scales, inter-item correlation should be â‰¥ 0.3

======================================================================
REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE RISK SCALE EVALUATION
======================================================================
Overall Regulatory & Compliance Risk Mean: 3.313
Interpretation: Moderate regulatory risk concern (Some regulatory awareness)

Regulatory & Compliance Risk Breakdown:
RC1 (Regulatory uncertainty - crypto/NFT rules): 3.393
RC2 (Legal/tax compliance concerns): 3.233

Regulatory & Compliance Risk Analysis:
Higher Regulatory Concern: RC1 (M = 3.393)
Lower Regulatory Concern: RC2 (M = 3.233)

Regulatory Dimension Analysis:
Regulatory Uncertainty (Crypto/NFT Rules): 3.393
Legal/Tax Compliance Concerns: 3.233

Regulatory Risk Profile Analysis:
Key Insight: Regulatory uncertainty is greater concern than compliance - Need clearer rules

Regulatory Barrier Assessment:
Regulatory Adoption Barrier: MODERATE - Some regulatory awareness but not prohibitive

Regulatory Risk Segmentation:
High Regulatory Risk (â‰¥4.0): 219 (42.4%)
Moderate Regulatory Risk (3.0-3.9): 152 (29.5%)
Low Regulatory Risk (<3.0): 145 (28.1%)

Regulatory vs Other Risk Comparisons:
Compare with other risk findings:
- Overall Risk Perception (RP): 4.016 (High general risk awareness)
- Security Risk (RP2): 4.151 (Highest specific risk concern)
- Regulatory Risk (RC): 3.313
Risk Hierarchy Position: Regulatory risks are lower than other risk categories

Regulatory Adoption Implications:
Policy Needs: Limited regulatory concerns - current uncertainty acceptable for adoption

Regulatory Strategy Analysis:
Strategy Priority: Current regulatory environment acceptable - monitor for changes

Regulatory Communication Analysis:
Communication Strategy: Significant regulatory concerns - targeted regulatory communication needed

Economic Motivation vs Regulatory Risk:
Note: Compare with Economic Motivation findings:
- Economic Motivation (EM): 4.129 (Strong economic motivation)
- 72.9% High Economic Motivation users
- Regulatory Risk (RC): 3.313
Economic-Regulatory Balance: High economic motivation with manageable regulatory concerns - Favorable risk-reward balance

INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
======================================================================
Cronbach's Alpha Interpretation:
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.9  : Excellent reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.8  : Good reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.7  : Acceptable reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.6  : Questionable reliability
â€¢ Î± < 0.6  : Poor reliability

Inter-item Correlation (2-item scales):
â€¢ r â‰¥ 0.3  : Adequate correlation
â€¢ r < 0.3  : Poor item relationship

Regulatory & Compliance Risk Scale Interpretation:
â€¢ Mean â‰¥ 4.0 : High regulatory concerns (strong barriers to adoption)
â€¢ Mean 3.5-3.9 : Moderate-high regulatory concerns (significant concerns)
â€¢ Mean 3.0-3.4 : Moderate regulatory concerns (some awareness)
â€¢ Mean < 3.0 : Low regulatory concerns (limited concerns)

RC Components:
â€¢ RC1: Regulatory uncertainty (unclear crypto/NFT regulations)
â€¢ RC2: Legal/tax compliance concerns (potential legal implications)

GameFi Regulatory Research Implications:
â€¢ High RC scores indicate regulatory barriers to mass adoption
â€¢ RC1 shows need for clearer cryptocurrency and NFT regulations
â€¢ RC2 reveals compliance anxiety requiring guidance and support
â€¢ Regulatory vs other risk comparisons show relative barrier importance
â€¢ Economic motivation vs regulatory risk reveals risk-reward calculations
â€¢ High regulatory concerns require policy advocacy and user education
â€¢ Regulatory strategy should address both uncertainty and compliance needs
â€¢ Communication strategies must address regulatory anxiety for adoption
