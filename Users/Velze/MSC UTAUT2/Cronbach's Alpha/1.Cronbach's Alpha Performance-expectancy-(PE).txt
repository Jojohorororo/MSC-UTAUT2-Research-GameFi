INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
============================================================
Cronbach's Alpha Interpretation:
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.9  : Excellent reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.8  : Good reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.7  : Acceptable reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.6  : Questionable reliability
â€¢ Î± < 0.6  : Poor reliability

Corrected Item-Total Correlations:
â€¢ r â‰¥ 0.3  : Good item discrimination
â€¢ r < 0.3  : Consider removing item

Performance Expectancy Scale Interpretation:
â€¢ Mean â‰¥ 4.0 : High utility (strong perceived usefulness)
â€¢ Mean 3.0-3.9 : Moderate utility (neutral to positive usefulness)
â€¢ Mean < 3.0 : Low utility (poor perceived usefulness)

PE Components:
â€¢ PE1: Financial earning ability (play-to-earn effectiveness)
â€¢ PE2: Digital asset opportunities (NFT/token ownership)
â€¢ PE3: Comparative gaming benefits (vs traditional games)
â€¢ PE4: Asset ownership/control (digital property rights)
â€¢ PE5: Dual utility effectiveness (gaming + financial value)

GameFi Research Implications:
â€¢ Low PE scores indicate perceived utility barriers to adoption
â€¢ High PE scores suggest strong performance expectations support adoption
â€¢ Compare PE components to identify specific utility strengths/weaknesses
â€¢ PE3 shows GameFi positioning relative to traditional gaming
â€¢ PE5 captures the unique dual-purpose value proposition of GameFi
