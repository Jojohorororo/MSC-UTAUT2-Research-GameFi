=================================================================
RISK PERCEPTION SCALE EVALUATION
=================================================================
Overall Risk Perception Mean: 4.016
Interpretation: High risk perception (Strong concerns about GameFi risks)

Risk Perception Breakdown:
RP1 (Financial risks - volatility/losses): 4.072
RP2 (Security vulnerabilities): 4.151
RP3 (Sustainability concerns): 3.952
RP3.1 (Technology/market uncertainty): 3.891

Risk Perception Analysis:
Highest Risk Concern: RP2 (M = 4.151)
Lowest Risk Concern: RP3.1 (M = 3.891)

Risk Dimension Analysis:
Financial Risk Concerns: 4.072
Security Risk Concerns: 4.151
Sustainability Risk Concerns: 3.952
Technology/Market Uncertainty: 3.891

Risk Profile Analysis:
Key Insight: Security vulnerabilities are the primary risk concern

Risk Barrier Assessment:
Adoption Barrier Level: HIGH - Strong risk perceptions may significantly hinder adoption

Risk Tolerance Segmentation:
High Risk Perception (â‰¥4.0): 346 (67.1%)
Moderate Risk Perception (3.0-3.9): 127 (24.6%)
Low Risk Perception (<3.0): 43 (8.3%)

Risk vs Economic Motivation Analysis:
Note: Compare these results with Economic Motivation (EM) findings:
- EM Overall Mean: 4.129 (Strong economic motivation)
- 72.9% High Economic Motivation users
- RP Overall Mean: 4.016
Risk-Economic Profile: High risk awareness BUT strong economic motivation - Risk-reward trade-off behavior

GameFi Risk Management Implications:
Risk Management Priority: Platform security and exploit prevention should be top priority

Adoption Risk Implications:
Adoption Strategy: Majority perceive high risks - extensive risk mitigation required for mass adoption

Risk Communication Analysis:
Communication Strategy: High uncertainty - requires extensive education and transparency initiatives

â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.8  : Good reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.7  : Acceptable reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.6  : Questionable reliability
â€¢ Î± < 0.6  : Poor reliability

Corrected Item-Total Correlations:
â€¢ r â‰¥ 0.3  : Good item discrimination
â€¢ r < 0.3  : Consider removing item

Risk Perception Scale Interpretation:
â€¢ Mean â‰¥ 4.0 : High risk perception (strong barriers to adoption)
â€¢ Mean 3.5-3.9 : Moderate-high risk perception (significant concerns)
â€¢ Mean 3.0-3.4 : Moderate risk perception (some awareness)
â€¢ Mean < 3.0 : Low risk perception (limited concerns)

RP Components:
â€¢ RP1: Financial risks (volatility, potential losses)
â€¢ RP2: Security vulnerabilities (hacks, scams, exploits)
â€¢ RP3: Sustainability concerns (long-term economic model viability)
â€¢ RP3.1: Technology/market uncertainty (overall GameFi ecosystem risks)

GameFi Risk Research Implications:
â€¢ High RP scores indicate significant adoption barriers
â€¢ RP1 shows sensitivity to financial volatility and loss potential
â€¢ RP2 reveals security trust issues requiring platform assurance
â€¢ RP3 indicates sustainability skepticism affecting long-term commitment
â€¢ RP3.1 shows technology uncertainty requiring education and transparency
â€¢ Risk-Economic Motivation comparison reveals risk-reward trade-off behavior
â€¢ Risk segmentation helps identify different user risk tolerance profiles
â€¢ Primary risk concerns guide targeted risk mitigation strategies
