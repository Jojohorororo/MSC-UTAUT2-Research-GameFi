EM1 (Primary crypto/NFT motivation): 4.217
EM2 (Financial reward dependency): 4.006
EM3 (Financial > gameplay priority): 4.165

High Economic Motivation (â‰¥4.0): 376 (72.9%)
Moderate Economic Motivation (3.0-3.9): 92 (17.8%)
Low Economic Motivation (<3.0): 48 (9.3%)

GameFi Sustainability Analysis:
Platform Sustainability: High economic dependency - platform sustainability tied to financial rewards

INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
=================================================================
Cronbach's Alpha Interpretation:
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.9  : Excellent reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.8  : Good reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.7  : Acceptable reliability
â€¢ Î± â‰¥ 0.6  : Questionable reliability
â€¢ Î± < 0.6  : Poor reliability

Corrected Item-Total Correlations:
â€¢ r â‰¥ 0.3  : Good item discrimination
â€¢ r < 0.3  : Consider removing item

Economic Motivation Scale Interpretation:
â€¢ Mean â‰¥ 4.0 : Strong economic motivation (primarily financial focus)
â€¢ Mean 3.5-3.9 : Moderate-high economic motivation (significant financial focus)
â€¢ Mean 3.0-3.4 : Moderate economic motivation (balanced financial-gaming)
â€¢ Mean < 3.0 : Weak economic motivation (gaming-focused)

EM Components:
â€¢ EM1: Primary crypto/NFT motivation (earning as main driver)
â€¢ EM2: Financial reward dependency (sensitivity to reward changes)
â€¢ EM3: Financial priority over gameplay (extrinsic vs intrinsic balance)

GameFi Economic Research Implications:
â€¢ High EM scores indicate extrinsically motivated users
â€¢ EM2 shows platform loyalty sensitivity to reward structures
â€¢ EM3 reveals user value prioritization (financial vs gaming)
â€¢ Strong economic motivation requires sustainable reward systems
â€¢ Low economic motivation suggests intrinsic gaming appeal
â€¢ Economic segmentation helps target different user motivations
â€¢ High economic dependency may predict churn if rewards decrease
