TRUST IN TECHNOLOGY SCALE EVALUATION
=================================================================
Overall Trust in Technology Mean: 3.433
Interpretation: Moderate trust in technology (Some confidence)

Trust in Technology Breakdown:
TT1 (Blockchain/smart contract trust): 3.882
TT2 (Digital asset security confidence): 3.490
TT3 (Developer trustworthiness): 2.926

Trust in Technology Analysis:
Highest Trust Aspect: TT1 (M = 3.882)
Lowest Trust Aspect: TT3 (M = 2.926)

Trust Dimension Analysis:
Technology Trust (Blockchain/Smart Contracts): 3.882
Security Confidence (Digital Assets): 3.490
Developer Trust (Platform Credibility): 2.926

Trust Profile Analysis:
Key Insight: Technology trust exceeds human/platform trust (tech > people)

Trust Barrier Assessment:
Trust Adoption Support: MODERATE - Some trust concerns may limit adoption

Trust Segmentation:
High Trust (â‰¥4.0): 223 (43.2%)
Moderate Trust (3.0-3.9): 169 (32.8%)
Low Trust (<3.0): 124 (24.0%)

Trust vs Risk Perception Analysis:
Note: Compare these results with Risk Perception (RP) findings:
- RP Overall Mean: 4.016 (High risk perception)
- RP2 (Security vulnerabilities): 4.151 (Highest risk concern)
- TT Overall Mean: 3.433
- TT2 (Digital asset security confidence): 3.490
Trust-Risk Profile: Moderate trust and high risk perception - Mixed confidence signals

Technology Adoption Readiness:
Blockchain Readiness: Moderate blockchain/smart contract confidence - good adoption potential

Security Confidence Analysis:
Security Trust: Some digital asset security concerns - matches high security risk perception

Developer Trust Implications:
Platform Credibility: Low developer trust - significant credibility building required

Trust Building Strategy Analysis:
Priority Strategy: Focus on developer transparency and platform governance
