CREATING VISUALIZATIONS...
============================================================

1. Basic Response Distribution Chart

2. Distribution Curve/Histogram
Distribution Analysis:
   • Skewness: -0.960 (0 = symmetric, <0 = left-skewed, >0 = right-skewed)
   • Kurtosis: 0.396 (0 = normal, >0 = peaked, <0 = flat)
   • Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk): p = 0.0000
     ** Data may not be normally distributed (p ≤ 0.05)

3. Box Plot Analysis (FIXED - No More Overlapping!)
Box Plot Insights:
   ** Mean ≈ Median (3.96 ≈ 4.00): Symmetric distribution
   • IQR = 2.00: High variability - wide range of opinions
   • 50% of responses fall between 3.00 and 5.00
   • Distribution shape: symmetric
   ** No outliers detected - all responses within expected range
